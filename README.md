## üì¶ Installation

### With [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

**Local/dev:**

```lua
{
  dir = "/path/to/gitty",
  name = "gitty",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",
  },
  config = function()
    require("gitty").setup()
  end,
  dev = true,
},
```

**Remote:**

```lua
{
  "stuckinsnow/gitty",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",
  },
  config = function()
    require("gitty").setup()
  end,
},
```

For AI assistance to work, you will need to create a new prompt in codecompanion, you can find that at the bottom of this README.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Gitty can be configured with various options:

```lua
require("gitty").setup({
  spinner_enabled = true,          -- Enable loading spinners
  preview_width = 0.6,             -- Width of preview windows (0.0-1.0)
  preview_height = 0.4,            -- Height of preview windows (0.0-1.0)
  split_diff_treesitter = false,   -- Enable syntax highlighting in split diff views
})
```

### Configuration Options

- **`spinner_enabled`** (boolean, default: `true`): Show loading spinners during async operations
- **`preview_width`** (number, default: `0.6`): Width ratio for preview windows (0.0 to 1.0)
- **`preview_height`** (number, default: `0.4`): Height ratio for preview windows (0.0 to 1.0)
- **`split_diff_treesitter`** (boolean, default: `false`): Enable tree-sitter syntax highlighting in the commit buffer of split diff views. When disabled, the commit view shows plain text for better performance and focus on differences.

## üß© Extensibility

- All picker actions are customizable via fzf-lua.
- Utility functions for opening buffers, rendering markdown, and more.
- Async helpers for smooth UX.

### üìã Copy Filenames Utility

Gitty provides a reusable utility for copying filenames to clipboard with smart path shortening. This is useful for adding context to AI prompts or documentation.

**For FZF buffer pickers** (extracts buffer numbers):

```lua
require("fzf-lua").buffers({
  actions = {
    ["ctrl-y"] = {
      fn = function(selection)
        require("gitty.utilities.file-utils").copy_buffer_filenames_to_clipboard(selection)
      end,
    },
  },
})
```

**For regular file pickers** (direct file paths):

```lua
require("fzf-lua").files({
  actions = {
    ["ctrl-y"] = {
      fn = function(selection)
        require("gitty.utilities.file-utils").copy_filenames_to_clipboard(selection)
      end,
    },
  },
})
```

**Customization options**:

```lua
-- Custom header, prefix, and exclude current buffer
require("gitty.utilities.file-utils").copy_filenames_to_clipboard(selection, {
  header = "Context: ",
  prefix = "* ",
  include_current = false
})
```

**Output format**:

```
Context:
- providers/github-compare/picker-utils.lua
- utilities/file-utils.lua
- init.lua
```

Path shortening shows the last 3 directory levels for better readability while maintaining context.
